A program that simulates the DVD video screensaver in the terminal.

Now even people without a display server can enjoy the thrill of watching the DVD icon hit the corner. Amazing!

# General info
This program was programmed in Python 3, so make sure before running it that you have Python 3.x installed. (Python 2.x
won't work)

This program should work on any OS that has Python 3 ported to it. This includes Windows, macOS, Linux, and BSD.

This program has no installer, nor does it need one, because it's literally just one py file. All you have to do after downloading the program is run it.
