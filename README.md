A program that simulates the DVD video screensaver in the terminal.

Now even people without a display server can enjoy the thrill of watching the DVD icon hit the corner. Amazing!

# General info
This program requires at least Python version 3.3. If you attempt to run this program on Python 3.2 or lower, it will not work. In a future release, I may get support for older Python 3 versions working. However, I have no plans for getting Python 2 support.

This program should work on any OS that has Python 3.3 (or newer) ported to it. This includes Windows, macOS, Linux, and BSD.

This program has no installer, nor does it need one, because it's literally just one py file. All you have to do after downloading the program is run it from the command line.
